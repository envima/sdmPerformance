# README – Sampled Presence-Absence Data (PA)

## Overview

This folder contains presence-absence (PA) datasets derived from the presence-absence rasters stored in the `paRaster` folder. The samples were generated by randomly selecting occurrence points at varying sample sizes for each virtual species raster. The files were generated using the R script `R/01_virtualspecies.R`

## Dependencies

* **Input Data Required:**

Presence-absence raster files (`.tif` format) located in the `paRaster` folder. These rasters represent binarized species distributions.

* **Coordinate Reference System:**
  The samples inherit the CRS from the presence-absence rasters and virtual species data: **EPSG:3577** (GDA94 / Australian Albers).

## Data Description

* **File Types:** The folder includes paired `.RDS` and `.gpkg` files.

* **Naming Convention:** Files follow the pattern `VSxx_yy_rr.RDS` and `VSxx_yy_rr.gpkg`, where:

  * `VSxx` denotes the virtual species ID (e.g., VS01 to VS10).
  * `yy` indicates the number of sampled points (40, 80, 120, 160, 200, or 400).
  * `rr` specifies the replicate number (1 to 10).

### `.RDS` Files

Each `.RDS` file is a `VSSampledPoints` list object containing:

* `type`: Sampling type (`"presence-absence"`)
* `detection.probability`: List with:

  * `detection.probability`: Detection rate
  * `correct.by.suitability`: Logical, whether detection is conditioned by suitability
* `error.probability`: False positive rate
* `bias`: Bias term
* `replacement`: Sampling with replacement
* `original.distribution.raster`: A `SpatRaster` object representing the binary PA raster used for sampling
* `sample.points`: A `data.frame` with the sampled locations:

  * `x`: x-coordinate
  * `y`: y-coordinate
  * `Real`: True presence (1) or absence (0)
  * `Observed`: Observed presence
* `sample.plot`: A recorded plot object
* `sample.prevalence`: Named numeric vector with:

  * `true.sample.prevalence`
  * `observed.sample.prevalence`

### `.gpkg` Files

Each `.gpkg` file is a spatial representation of the `sample.points` table stored as an `sf` object. These files contain the following columns:

* `Real`: True presence (1) or absence (0)
* `Observed`: Observed presence
* `geom`: Geometry column of type `POINT` (inherited from the raster CRS, **EPSG:3577 – GDA94 / Australian Albers**)

## Sampling Protocol

* Sampling was performed on the presence-absence rasters with six different sample sizes and ten replicates for each sample size (e.g. 40 points are sampled ten times).
* The sampling type is presence-absence with a target sample prevalence of 0.75 (75% of the sampled data are presence points).
